### Hello, guys! 👋

I'm Rodrigo Lourenço from sunny Brazil. Been tinkering as a Front-End Developer since 2015, and now I'm flexing my skills as a Software Engineer at [Tiendanube/Nuvemshop](https://www.nuvemshop.com.br/). 💪🏻☁️

When I'm not glued to my screen, I'm all about movies, TV shows, or diving into some epic gaming adventures. But let's be real, my true love? It's coding. JavaScript and Node... you name it, I've probably played around with it.

Wanna track me down? Hit me up!

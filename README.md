### Hello, guys! 👋

I'm Rodrigo Lourenço from Brazil. I've been working as a Front-End Developer since 2015 and currently I'm Senior Front-End Engenieer at [Midway](https://www.midway.com.br/). 💪🏻

I really like movies, TV shows or even games but what I love ever is the code. I've been making a lot of things so cool with ReactJS, GraphQL and Node.

Would you like to find me?

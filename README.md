### Hello, guys! 👋

I'm Rodrigo Lourenço from Brazil. I've been working as a Front-End Developer since 2015 and currently I'm Front-End Engenieer at [Gympass](https://gympass.com/) when we're helping the world find an activity to love. 💪🏻

I really like movies, TV shows or even games but what I love ever is the code. I've been making a lot of things so cool with ReactJS, GraphQL and Node.

```JS
if (wouldYouLikeToFindMe) {
  console.log('Follow me on:')
}
```
